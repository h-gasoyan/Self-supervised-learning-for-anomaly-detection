# Self-supervised-learning-for-anomaly-detection

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for anomaly detection using self-supervised learning methods, specifically DINO's self-distillation and MAE's masked reconstruction.

## Abstract
This project enhances anomaly detection by leveraging self-supervised learning techniques, specifically DINO's self-distillation and MAE's masked reconstruction. DINO facilitates robust feature representation learning without the need for labeled data, while MAE reconstructs masked image parts to identify anomalies through reconstruction errors. K-means clustering was applied to understand how anomalous clusters differ from non-anomalous ones, assessing the separability and compactness of the clusters. Additionally, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were utilized to model the distribution of normal data and identify outliers, comparing the results before and after implementing self-supervised learning techniques.
